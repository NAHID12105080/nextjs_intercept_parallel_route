## Features in Detail

### Parallel Routes

The dashboard uses parallel routes to show multiple sections simultaneously:

- Analytics panel

### Intercepting Routes

Clicking on a user in the users list opens a modal instead of navigating away:

- URL remains as `/dashboard/users`
- Modal content is loaded via `/dashboard/users/@modal/[userId]`
- Smooth animations for opening/closing

### Animations

- Page transitions with Framer Motion
- Modal animations
- Smooth hover effects
- Loading states
